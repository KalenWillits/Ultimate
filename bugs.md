# Known bugs and limitations

> ~~The "logins.json" is not in a valid format for a clean json import. Instead the file has been opened in a context manager and loaded as a string then converted into a Pandas DataFrame with the "import_logins" function.~~

> ~~stage_processed_data variable does not return enough values and the counts are always 0.~~
